## lets keep some Cache for ourselves 
In a nutshell, the concept of caching revolves around utilising programming techniques to store data in a temporary location instead of retrieving it from the source each time.

Subsequently, caching can provide an application performance boost as it is faster to access data from the temporary location than it is to fetch the data from the source each time, such as from database, web service, etc.
